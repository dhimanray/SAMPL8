# METHODOLOGY

Method:
We have computed absolute binding free energies for all ten host-guest
systems via explicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using
a standard double decoupling protocol and the polarizable atomic multipole
AMOEBA force field. All simulations were performed with the Tinker8 and
Tinker9 software running on CPUs and GPUs, respectively. All calculations
used the AMOEBA force field. AMOEBA parameters were generated manually by
members of the Ponder lab, or via the AMOEBA FORGE parameterization engine
developed by Chris Ho in collaboration with the Ponder lab. Our standard
parameterization protocols and guidelines from the published literature
were followed. Each guest was modeled as a monoanion with a charge of -1,
and a 1:1 stoichiometry was assumed for each complex.

For each guest, a series of MD simulations were performed starting from the
guest in water (solvation leg) and from the host-guest complex in water
(host-guest leg). In both legs a series windows were used to first annihilate
electrostatics in the guest, followed by decoupling of guest vdw interactions.
The calculations were performed on initial 50 Ang cubic systems under the NPT
ensemble, and with eight sodium ions added to the host-guest simulations to
neutralize the host. No other ions were added, and no attempt was made to
neutralize the guest. Simulations used PME for long range electrostatics,
and a 9 Ang cutoff on vdw terms incremented by an isotropic vdw long range
correction. A two-stage RESPA-style integrator was used for the MD with a
2 fs outer time step. MD trajectory snapshots were saved every 1 ps. For
host-guest MD windows, a single flat-bottomed harmonic distance restraint
between groups of atoms was used to maintain binding of the guest. These
restraints were chosen such that they were not violated during unrestrained
simulations runs on the bound host-guest complex.

Each sampling window was simulated for 10 ns (guest solvation and TEMOA
bound windows) or for 30 ns (TEETOA bound windows) and the initial 1 ns was
discarded as equilibration. The production simulations beyond the initial
1 ns were then analyzed using the standard BAR method between adjacent
windows to compute free energy differences. The difference between the
sum of the solvation and host-guest legs, after analytical correction of
the host- guest sum for release of the flat-bottomed harmonic restraint,
was taken as the binding energy estimate. Statistical error was estimated
for each BAR calculation, using a bootstrap procedure with full replacement
as well as from the error analysis described in Bennett's original paper
on the BAR method. These errors were combined to get a total statistical
error for each binding free energy prediction.

All binding free energies were computed two or three times via repeats of
the above protocol for each host-guest system. The predictions submitted to
SAMPL8 were based on BAR results from the longest available simulations
(TEETOA) or from combined simulation data (TEMOA) for each system.
