#
# For the GDCC challenge, TEMOA-G3 binding values will not be judged, as literature values are available.

Method:
Standard binding free energies were computed using the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07894) on OpenMM 7.3.1 with modified neighbor lists. The initial structures were prepared in Maestro with the guests manually docked into the hosts. Using AmberTools, the complexes were assigned GAFF2 AM1-BCC parameters and solvated in a water box with a 12 Angstrom solvent buffer and sodium counterions to balance the charge. No additional ions were added as the 10 mM experimental buffer was deemed too small to be significant. Intermol was used to convert resulting systems into DMS format. Each complex was then energy minimized and thermalized at 300 K and 1 bar. Starting at the bound state at lambda = 0, we annealed all systems for 250 ps to lambda = 1/2 with the ATM alchemical potential energy funtion for leg 1, in order to obtain initial configurations to begin the replica exchange alchemical calculations for each leg. The first 40 heavy atoms of TEETOA and TEMOA, which correspond to the lower portion of each host, were restrained with a flat-bottom harmonic potential of force constant 25.0 kcal/mol/(Angstroms)^2 and a tolerance of 1.5 Angstroms.

MD calculations employed the OpenMM MD engine using the Single-Decoupling integrator (github.com/rajatkrpal/openmm_sdm_plugin.git) with the OpenCL platform. ATM calculations employed the linear alchemical potential with 11 lambda values for each leg uniformly distributed between 0 and 1/2. The soft-core potential u_sc with u_max = 300 kcal/mol and u_0 = 100 kcal/mol was used. The ATM translation vector for the ligand was set to (22, 22, 22) Angstroms corresponding to a CM-CM distance of 38 Angstroms between the host and the guest. The guest was sequestered within the binding site using a flat-bottom harmonic potential based on the distance between the centers of mass of the host and the ligand with a force constant of 25 kcal/mol/Angstroms^2 applied for separation greater than 4.5 Angstroms. Perturbation energy samples and trajectory frames were saved every 5 ps. Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREM) in lambda-space was performed every 5 ps. The Langevin thermostat with a time constant of 2 ps was used to maintain the temperature at 300 K at constant volume. Each replica for leg 1 was simulated for a minimum of 10 ns, and 20 ns for leg 2. Binding free energies and the corresponding uncertainties (3-sigmas) were computed from the perturbation energy samples using UWHAM, discarding the first half of the trajectory, followed by the addition of the concentration-dependent standard state term of 0.87 kcal/mol that corresponds to 300 K temperature and the volume V_site of a sphere of radius 4.5 Angstroms.

The predictions for TEMOA-G2 and TEETOA-G2 included both protonation states of the guest and were obtained from the binding free energy combination formula (Eq. 56 from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445424/) assuming a pH of 11.5 and the experimental pKa of 9.17 for 4-bromophenol.

The calculations reported here were produced and validated in concert with those of the physical PMF/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/MD-US method submitted separately to SAMPL8 by Nanjie Deng et al.

Model uncertainties for the TEMOA complexes were set to 2.5 kcal/mol to reflect the systematic overestimation of binding free energies for these systems observed with the GAFF2/AM1-BCC/TIP3P force field. The model uncertainties for the TEETOA complexes were set as the larger of the SEM and the difference between the ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM and PMF/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/MD-US predictions.
