Method:
Parameters for the host and guest molecules were generated through ParamChem. All simulations were performed with the NAMD software. A cylindrical potential was defined to restrain the center of mass of the guest and prevent
unwanted interactions with the the Host(CB8). The cylindrical potential was as a cylinder centered on the principal axis of 
the Host with a radius slightly higher than the radius of the Host molecule. Guest molecules were dragged out from the binding pocket inside of the host
along the principal axis of the cylindrical potential as the reaction coordinate using an SMD simulation in 10ns. 18 replicas were generated along the reaction coordinate for the Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling (REUS) simulation.
These replicas were equilibrated for 1 ns with a 5 kcal/mol force constant in their corresponding reaction coordinate. The cylindrical potential had a radius of 7 Angstrom and a force constant of 1 kcal/mol. 
The equilibrated systems were then used as the starting point for the REUS simulation.Exchange attempts were made every 2 ps

Each system was solvated in a 56 x 56 x 56 TIP3P water box. REUS simulations were run under NPT ensemble for about 10 ns per replica using Langevin thermostat
at a temperature of 298 K with a friction constant of 1.0 ps-1 and Langevin Piston to keep the pressure at 1 bar. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
with SHAKE algorithm in NAMD and the simulation time step was 2 fs. The PMFs were calculated using WHAM program.

Two different corrections were added to the binding energies: 1. Volume correction: free energy cost associated with restraining the guest
in the cylindrical potential was calculated from the volume that guest molecule samples in the unbound state.
2. The free energy cost of turning on the restraint was calculated using thermodynamic integration (TI) method through gradually decreasing the force 
constant from 3 kcal/mol to 0 in 10 lambda states. The absolute binding free energy was then obtained through a thermodynamic cylcle with considering the corrections.
