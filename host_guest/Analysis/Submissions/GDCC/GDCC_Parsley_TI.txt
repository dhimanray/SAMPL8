Method:

All simulations were performed using the attach-pull-release method (10.1002/jcc.23398, 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405) 
with pAPRika 1.0.4, and OpenMM 7.4.2 as the simulation engine. Fourteen windows were used for the attach phase, 
and up to 46 umbrella sampling windows during the pull phase spaced at 0.4 Angstrom intervals, starting at 6 Angstroms 
from the noninteracting anchor particles and extended to a maximum distance of 24 Angstroms. Fourteen windows were used 
for the release phase. Each window included up to 40 ns simulation time. 

The starting structures were obtained by docking using oedock from Openeye Toolkits. Each system was solvated with 
2500 TIP3P waters in a rectangular box whose dimensions were approximately 40 x 40 x 63 cubic Angstroms, sodium or 
chloride counterions (with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614)) were added as needed to neutralize 
each host-guest system, and additional NaCl ions were added to obtain experimental conditions of the same ionic strength.
AM1BCC partial atomic charges were generated with oequacpac as implemented with Openeye Toolkits. The bonded and Lennard-Jones
parameters were assigned based on OpenFF v1.2.0 using the Openff-toolkit. 

The attach-pull-release windows were prepared using pAPRika 1.0.4, which consists of: adding non-interacting anchor particles, 
Boresch-style restraint setup, the addition of solvent and ions, and preparation of OpenMM XML files. 
As described elsewhere (10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405), six restraints (one distance restraint, two angle restraints, and three torsional
restraints) were used to position the host relative to the anchor particles throughout the entire APR process to impose a lab frame 
of reference. Moreover, three restraints were applied to the guest molecule; two for the translation (r and theta) and one for the
orientation (beta). The guest molecule is pulled from host along the reaction coordinate r.
The force constant values used for the host static restraints and the guest orientational restraints were:

distance restraints = 10.0 kcal/mol/A^2
angle and torsional restraints = 100 kcal/mol/rad^2

Host conformational "Jack" restraints were used during the attachment phase to facilitate sampling during the pulling phase, as
described in 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405. Four distance restraints (2 horizontal and 2 vertical) were used on the the meta carbons 
of the upper diphenyl ethers at the rim of the host, and two diagonal distance restraints on the methyl/ethyl groups to enlarge 
the cavity and reduce energetic barriers when removing the guest out of the cavity. 
The force constant values used for the host conformational restraints were:

distance restraints = 14.0 kcal/mol/A^2
angle restraints = 13.0 kcal/mol/rad^2  

Four "wall" restraints were used to help define the bound state and prevent guest molecules from leaving the host during the 
attach phase. Restraints were set on the guest relative to the first upper cavity phenyl carbon connected to the lower cavity
ether groups.
The force constant values used for the wall restraints were:

distance restraints = 50 kcal/mol/A^2
angle restraints = 14 kcal/mol/rad^2 

Equilibration was done at a constant temperature of 298.15 K using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency 1.0 ps^-1 
and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (1 atm). All systems were minimized up to a maximum of 5000 steps 
and equilibrated for 1ns.  

Production simulations were run up to 40 ns per window at 298.15 K with temperature control using a Langevin thermostat 
with collision frequency 1.0 ps-1 and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (at 1 atm). 
Nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 9.0 Angstrom cutoff. At the same time, long-range electrostatics were 
handled with the PME method and an isotropic dispersion correction is used for the long-range Lennard-Jones. The simulation 
time step was set to 4 fs with Hydrogen Mass Repartitioning (HMR). 

All simulations were analyzed with thermodynamic integration (TI) and/or multibennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator approaches.
The SEMs were obtained using block analysis (described in 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405).

Guests G1, and G3 through G5 have titrable carboxylates with pKa values of 2.69, 4.86, 4.10, and 4.26, respectively. Guest G2 
had a titrable hydroxyl group with a pKa value of 9.09. The experimental pH was over 11 and we expected these functional groups
to be fully deprotonated. Only the negatively charged variants of these guests were considered for our calculations. 
  
Guest G1 also had a hydroxyl as a second titratable group with pKa at 12.83, increasing the potential number of protonation states 
for this guest to four. However, only two protonation state populations are predicted (via chemaxon chemicalize) to be possible at the 
experimental pH. It may be necessary to consider both population states (state1=95.52%, state2=4.48%) for binding free energy 
predictions. For our calculations we chose population state1 which had the carboxylate deprotonated and the hydroxyl protonated.  
The favored population state1 was also confirmed with Openeye Toolkit. State2 may or may not need to be considered in follow up
investigations.  

During our initial docking experiments and determining starting pose, we observed guest G2 with two binding modes: 
(1) the negatively charged hydroxyl pointing out towards solvent, and (2) the negatively charged hydroxyl pointing 
towards the cavity. After some initial tests, pose 2 was discarded since it was shown to be unstable and had unfavorable
binding free energy.
