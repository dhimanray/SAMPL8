#
# For the GDCC challenge, TEMOA-G3 binding values will not be judged, as literature values are available.
# Note there are two sets of hosts TEMOA and TEETOA.

Method:
In the PMF method used here (J. Phys. Chem. B 2017, 121, 10484âˆ’10497. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09406), the computation of the standard binding free energy involves the following steps: (1) applying a harmonic restraint on the three Euler angles of the guest in the bound state to restrain guest orientation; (2) applying a harmonic restraint on the polar and azimuthal angles in spherical coordinates to restrain the guest center along a fixed axis when it binds/unbinds; (3) reversibly extracting the guest from the binding pocket along the chosen axis until it reaches the bulk region; (4) release the restraints on the guest center and guest orientation, which allows the guest to occupy the standard volume and rotate freely in the bulk solvent. The standard binding free energy is then obtained by summing up the reversible work associated with each of the above steps.

The initial structures were prepared in Maestro with the guests manually docked into the hosts. The complexes were assigned GAFF2 AM1-BCC parameters and solvated in a water box with a 12 Angstrom solvent buffer and sodium counterions to balance the charge using AmberTools. No additional ions were added as the 10 mM experimental buffer was deemed too small to be significant. Each complex was then energy minimized and thermalized at 300 K and 1 bar using OpenMM and the resulting systems were converted to GROMACS format with Intermol. 

The position and orientation of the guest relative to the host was controlled using coordinate systems which consisted of 3 reference atoms of the host (P1, P2, and P3) and 3 reference atoms of the guest (L1, L2, and L3) [Boresch, et al. J. Phys. Chem. 107, 9535 (2003)]. For all hosts, P1 was the center of the bottom ring of each host and L1 was the center of each guest approximately 5 Angstroms away from P1. The PMF was calculated along the P1-L1 distance (from approximately 4.5 to 18.0 Angstroms) using umbrella sampling with biasing potentials having a force constant of 1000 kJ mol^-1 nm^-2. The three Euler angles and two polar and azimuthal angles were restrained using harmonic potentials with a force constant of 1,000 kJ mol^-1 rad^-2 centered on the angles of the thermalized structures such that the guest was pulled straight out of the pocket of the host while minimizing collisions with the sidechains of the rim of the host. 

Equilibration (1.2 ns) and production (20 ns) umbrella sampling was then initiated over 20 umbrella windows from a distance of 0.5 nm to 17 nm from within the binding region to the bulk along the P1-L1 axis. WHAM analysis was then run to generate the PMF. The free energy of releasing the angular restraints in the bulk and that in the bound state are both computed using BAR.

The predictions for TEMOA-G2 and TEETOA-G2 included both protonation states of the guest and were obtained from the binding free energy combination formula (Eq. 56 from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445424/) assuming a pH of 11.5 and the experimental pKa of 9.17 for 4-bromophenol.

The calculations reported here were produced and validated in concert with those of the alchemical ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM method submitted separately to SAMPL8 by Gallicchio et al.

Model uncertainties for the TEMOA complexes were set to 2.5 kcal/mol to reflect the systematic overestimation of binding free energies for these systems observed with the GAFF2/AM1-BCC/TIP3P force field. The model uncertainties for the TEETOA complexes were set as the larger of the SEM and the difference between the ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM and PMF/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/MD-US predictions.
