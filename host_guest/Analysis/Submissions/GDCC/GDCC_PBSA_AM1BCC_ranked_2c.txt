# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "GDCC" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the GDCC challenge, TEMOA-G3 binding values will not be judged, as literature values are available.
# Note there are two sets of hosts TEMOA and TEETOA.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
Initial structures of host, guest molecules were protonated using Protonate3D method implemented in Molecular Operating Environment(MOE) v2019. Complex structures were generated by docking guest molecules in to the binding cavity of the host using general docking followed by a amber10:EHT minimization in MOE. All systems were prepared using gaff2 and TIP4P-EW force fields and they were neutralized to mimic the ionic strength of  the experimental conditions using Na+ and Cl- ions using parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614). In all simulations, Lanevin thermostat has been used for temepreture, and pressure is coupled to 1 atm using isotropic position scaling. The systems were relaxed with restraints on the host-guest systems(100 and 50 kcal/mol), only on the guest (10 kcal/mol) and no restraints. Each step was 20000 steps with NVT conditions. Heating the systems was performed in a ten-step procedure from 0 K to 300 K. First, all atoms  were restrained (3 kcal/mol) for 160 ps until 20 K. Then, only the heavy atoms except for the solvent and ions were kept restrained (3 kcal/mol) for 250 ps until temperature reaches 200 K. Finally, all restraints were removed and the temperature inreased up to 300 K in three steps for 1100 ps in total. Before the producion step, the systems were equilibrated at 300 K for 0.5 ns using NPT. Non-bonded interactions were truncated with 12 angstrom cutoff, whereas long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with Particle Mesh Ewald. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE algorithm. The production runs were performed with 1 fs time-step and he length of the simulations were 50 ns. The simulations were performed using pmemd.cuda module. The binding free energies of the guest molecules were calculated using MMPBSA.py program in Amber18 using generalized born solvation model from the first 2 ns of the production runs with neglected solute  entropies (10.1517/17460441.2015.1032936).
