Note that we have typically selected, or attempted to select, reasonable protonation states and conformers of the hosts and guests, but these may be controversial, uncertain, or change upon binding, so participants are encouraged to exercise care in selecting which states are modeled. Typically selection of protonation states, tautomers and conformers is one major place where participant protocols differ and lead to different downstream results.
