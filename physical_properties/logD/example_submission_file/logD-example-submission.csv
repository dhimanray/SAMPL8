# LOGD PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Please specify compute time for training models and querying separately for empirical prediction methods.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used to run the simulations.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:
All the simulations were performed on two GeForce GTX 1080 on a single machine hosting an Intel Xeon Processor E5-2697 v4.
The replicas were divided into two sets of the same size and propagated in parallel on the two GPUs, while the exchange
stage was performed serially. We estimate the total wall-clock time spent doing parallel/serial work to be
approximately 95%/5% respectively.

# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical (MM)`, `Physical (QM)`, `Empirical`, or `Mixed`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Physical (MM)

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please list out the method details of predictions for each solvent pair considered.
#
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
#
# Please report SMILES strings and populations of all the microstates used in calculations in this section.

#
# Important: Please do not use phrases which are identical to the section headers of logD data. For example do not use "Octanol-water predictions:", 
# but use "Octanol-water predictions" instead (without the colon) or any other form. See example below.
