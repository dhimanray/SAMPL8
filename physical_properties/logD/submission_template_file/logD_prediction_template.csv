# LOGD PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for atleast one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have it's own header, as illustrated here.

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please list out the method details of predictions for each solvent pair considered.
#
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
#
# Please report SMILES strings and populations of all the microstates used in calculations in this section.

#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed, but you can turn in as many nonranked submissions as you want (we will still run analysis on them).
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
