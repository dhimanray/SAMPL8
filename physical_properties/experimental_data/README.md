# Experimental data for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge

This provides experimental results from GSK for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge, as described in the forthcoming manuscript "Automated High Throughput pKa and Distribution Coefficient Measurements of Pharmaceutical Compounds for the SAMPL8 Blind Prediction Challenge" by Bahr et al. (submitted to JCAMD), a copy of which will be deposited here.


## Manifest
